## Team-First, OKR and Hypothesis Driven Development Meaning

### Team First

I am a firm believer in a team-first approach to an organisation, instilling pride and stability in an organisations staff. Whilst there appears to be no clear evidence on a [teams stability outperforming a fluid team](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/depth-stable-or-fluid-teams-what-does-science-say), this is more due to a lack of the study itself than it actually being disproven. 

There should be no doubting from a common sense perspective however that people who develop a close bond over time with a shared purpose will perform better. It will also minimize the amount of times that teams are outside of the high performing stage of [Tuckmans stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development). Stable teams for me then are a winner, with the mantra "[bring your work to the people and not the people to work](https://medium.com/organize-agile/from-project-teams-to-stable-agile-teams-5934c271a8fc)" resonates with me and one I often cite this in the hope of assimilation.

Although not the purpose of this blog, appropriate team boundaries can be established utilising domain discovery methods such as [event storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/). Once domains are identified they can be divided amongst your organisation using common sense around what business problems make the most sense to live closely together. The target implementation aiming to reduce handovers and ensuring teams can provided business value by reaching a customer independently, as well as resourcing domains accordingly based on complexity or volume. For further information on identifying a suitable team layout for your organisation please see resources on  [team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/).

### OKRs

OKRs stand for Objectives & Key Results. You may have other terms for them as they are ultimately a goal setting tool that I have found extremely inspiring. They allow a bottom-up as well as top-down approach to your organisations strategy. This allows teams close to the problem domains described above to utilise their knowledge under their own volition at the correct time to deliver value like only they know how. This is a high trust relationship between those running the organisation and the engineers they have employed, but one that should reap dividends if implemented successfully.  

A team **mission** should help understand objectives for the lifecycle of the team and should be fairly static. **Objectives** based on this mission should be agreed strategically with more senior members of the organisation and addressed about every 90 days. They **key results** then should be time-bound and an agreed method of how you will measure the success of your objectives.

I recommend going to [what matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/) to learn more and also reading the [measure what matters book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Measure-What-Matters-Simple-Drives/dp/024134848X) for more information.

As a quick example though...

#### Beer Team OKRs

We have a established a team exclusively on making the hungovercoders drinking beer. Lets motivate them!

**Team Mission:** Ensure that the Hungovercodes Drink More Beer

**Objective:** Hungovercoders regularly go to the pub

**Key Results:**

- Five hungovercoders go to the pub at least once by the end of October 2022.
- Three hungovercoders go to the pub at least once a week by the end of November 2022.

#### Litter Team OKRs

We have a established a team exclusively on ensuring the hungovercoders pickup litter. Lets motivate them!

**Team Mission:** Ensure that the Hungovercodes Pickup Litter

**Objective:** Hungovercoders pickup litter

**Key Results:**

- Hungovercoders pickup 10 bags of rubbish a week by the end of September 2022.
- Hungovercoders local areas rate rubbish presence as reduced comparing September 2022 to November 2022.

As a reminder the OKRs are one of many frameworks for creating a measureable driving force for all of your teams. You may use something different but it is the one that I have identified the most. They key thing to remember is parallelising your workforce to deliver multiple streams of value independently with clear indications of success is an immense force if you design it correctly.

### Hypothesis Driven Development

The final piece of the jigsaw and what makes the whole thing tick! We now encourage the teams to hypothesise how they can meet their objectives and influence their key results. This is a great empowerment tool for each team as they are essentially being recognised as the experts in their field with free reign to ideate and implement. This is a huge compliment and motivational factor you now get for free by setting yourself up in a high trust organisational manner. Imagine an army of motivated teams each with an area of the business to think up ideas and deliver value, with clear agreed key results that were described up front. Winner winner chicken dinner! 

These hypotheses can reflect themselves in sprints or iterations of the team which last about every 2 weeks. The goal being proving or failing to prove a hypotheses correct, much like the scientific method. 

Some examples for the beer team might be:
* If we create a facebook group to encourage hungovercodes to socialise we will get three people to the pub in October!
* If we create a dedicated hungovercoders calendar app we will get two people going to the pub every week in November!

Some examples for the litter team might be:
* If we create a local neighbourhood whatsapp group to encourage hungovercodes and the community to pickup litter we will pickup 5 bags each week in October!
* If we create a rate my litter app we will see a reduction in presence between September 2022 and November 2022.

If you cannot get feedback from your teams on the success or failure of a hypotheses against a key result in around 2 weeks then you have clearly got issues in your organisational setup and should continue to revisit your team setup. Dare to dream the impossible dream and demand better from your organisation!
